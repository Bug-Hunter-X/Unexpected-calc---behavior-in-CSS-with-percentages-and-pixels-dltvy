/* Instead of directly using calc() with percentages and pixels, consider using a more reliable approach like flexbox or grid. This example demonstrates a flexbox solution: */
.container {
  display: flex;
  width: 100%;
}
.item {
  flex-grow: 1;
  margin-right: 10px; /* This provides the equivalent of 10px spacing */
  background-color: lightblue; /* Example styling */
}
/* If a pure CSS-only solution using calc() is required, you might need to introduce a JavaScript solution to ensure accurate measurement before setting the width using calc().  However, this is generally considered less efficient and more fragile than using flexbox or grid */
