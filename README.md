# Unexpected calc() Behavior in CSS
This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug related to the `calc()` function in CSS when combining percentages and other units like pixels.  The issue arises from unexpected calculation results in specific browser contexts or when dealing with complex layouts.

The `bug.css` file contains the problematic CSS code.  `bugSolution.css` provides a potential workaround or solution.  The problem is likely related to browser-specific handling of unit conversions within the `calc()` function, and the solution might involve using alternative techniques to achieve the desired layout or employing a more robust calculation method.
